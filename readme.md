# Solution Introduction

I enrich the website with a texteditor, which can show the preview of markdown and code. I have used npm package for editor and then I have saved data to localstorage so on again reload it is showing the same data. I have used Next.js framework for this purpose.

# How to run
First: `npm i`

Second: `npm run dev`
